*Equelle - A DSL for equations*

The first draft of Equelle, a domain-specific language (DSL) for equations, is developed with Spoofax, which is a platform for developing textual DSLs with full-featured Eclipse editor plug-ins. Spoofax adopts the Syntax Definition Formalism (SDF), which is a language for defining lexical and context-free syntax, as well as Stratego, which is a language for defining program transformation.

Equelle requires Spoofax 1.1, which in turn requires Eclipse 3.7 (which is not the last version of Eclipse, unfortunately).
