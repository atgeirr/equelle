The purpose of this document is to describe and specify Equelle
sufficiently accurate and complete that a first version of a compiler can
be produced. This is not a definitive specification, recent example
programs will have to be consulted for a more complete picture.

Since this document is not meant to be used as input for a
compiler-generator, parser, etc., it is written in natural language.

At the time of writing (2013.08.02) this will actually be in the form of
an example collection.
