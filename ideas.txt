Grids
=====

Grids are cell complexes.
Entities (and their dimensions) are cell(3), face(2), edge(1), vertex(0). Plurals are cells, faces, edges, vertices.
For lower-dimensional grids (< 3 dims) what should we do? Suggestion based on current needs:
2 dim: cell(2), face(1) == edge(1), vertex(0)
1 dim: cell(1), face(0) == edge(0) == vertex(0)
So for lower dimensions, there are synonyms that can be used interchangably (use what is best for method readability).



Structure of generated simulator
================================

Before generated code:
       - Create grid.
       - Read runtime parameters. Also: run-time vs. generate-time vs. written-in-Equelle parameters.
       - Strategy for timestepping.

Generated code (described in Equelle):
       - Timestep stability limits.
       - For one timestep, solve discrete equations, update fields.
       - Some interface to make fields available for output.

After generated code:
       - Output.
